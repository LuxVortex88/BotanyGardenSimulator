# Botany Garden Simulator ðŸŒ¸

## Overview

**Botany Garden Simulator** is a Python-based simulation tool designed to model seasonal blooming patterns of various flowers. The simulation leverages synthetic data to visualize and analyze how different flowers bloom across the seasons, providing insights into flower growth and garden management.

This tool is built using Python and optimized for use in **Jupyter Notebooks** and **Google Colab**. It allows users to simulate seasonal bloom patterns, adjust flower attributes, and visualize growth dynamics.

## Features

- **Flower Class Simulation**: Define flowers with attributes like bloom season, color, and height.
- **Seasonal Blooming Simulation**: Track when flowers bloom in different seasons (Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter).
- **Visualization**: Plot flower blooming patterns and garden growth with **Matplotlib**.
- **Synthetic Data**: Generate realistic but synthetic data for experimenting with different garden scenarios.
  
## Installation

#1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/[your_username]/BotanyGardenSimulator.git
Navigate to the project directory:

cd BotanyGardenSimulator
Install required dependencies:


pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Open the Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab file:

garden_simulation.ipynb

2. Run the notebook cells sequentially to simulate flower blooming patterns across different seasons.

Modify the flower attributes or seasons to test various blooming scenarios.

# Example: Define a flower and check its blooming season
flower = Flower(name="Tulip", color="Red", bloom_start="Spring", bloom_end="Summer", avg_height_cm=30)
print(flower.is_blooming("Spring"))  # Output: True

3. Commit Message Format

When committing, you want clear, concise messages that explain the changes in each commit. Hereâ€™s a professional format to follow:

1. **First commit**:
   - **Commit message**: 
     ```bash
     Initial commit - Create Botany Garden Simulator with Flower Class and Blooming Logic
     ```
   - **Commit description**: 
     ```bash
     Added core functionality for the garden simulation. Created the Flower class to model flower attributes and seasonal blooming behavior.
     ```

2. Subsequent commits:
   - **Commit message**: 
     ```bash
     Add seasonal bloom simulation and data generation
     ```
   - **Commit description**: 
     ```bash
     Implemented logic to simulate seasonal bloom patterns using synthetic data for a variety of flowers.
     Added Matplotlib visualization for bloom status across seasons.
     ```

3. Final commit (before push):
   - **Commit message**: 
     ```bash
     Finalize Botany Garden Simulator with README and usage instructions
     ```
   - **Commit description**: 
     ```bash
     Added a comprehensive README file with installation, usage, and contribution instructions. Updated example code snippets and fixed minor bugs in bloom simulation.
     ```

4. Final Steps

1. **Create the repository** on GitHub (if you havenâ€™t already).
2. **Push** your code:
   - First time push:
     ```bash
     git remote add origin https://github.com/[your_username]/BotanyGardenSimulator.git
     git branch -M main
     git push -u origin main
     ```
3. Update your **GitHub repo** with the README (paste it into the "README.md" file on GitHub if you created it locally).

---

With this setup, your repo will be well-organized, professional, and easy for others to understand. Youâ€™ll also have a clear structure for expanding and improving the simulation in the future.

Let me know if you need further adjustments or help with pushing to GitHub!
